	- [x] Cmd view with control
	- [x] Game loop
	- [x] Bugfixes


##Wishlist
- [ ] There is currently no point where players leave the game (`gameF` flag unset). On the other hand, the player's game state is checked in the `nextPlayer` function. Players could be put out of game by checking after every handing cards whether the deck is empty and they have no cards on hand. Then `gameOver` could be reduced to counting the number of active players.
- [ ] Move playerSortHand() to an appropriate place (currently in cmd_input)
- [ ] Encapsule game start (game.c) // currently expanded before game loop
- [ ] Ask and start new game after finished (game.c)
- [ ] Set attacker and defender in next games according to who lost before (rules.h)
- [ ] Re-Implement stacks/lists using glib to have less maintenance (evil amout of work)

	- [x] Keep cards in order after playing
	- [x] Get number of human players and their names as program argument
	- [x] Set cursor to valid position after playing, not before
	- [x] Let cardBeats also check if an attacking card has already been beaten by some other card
	- [x] Remove card face member and all functions using it. It is actually useless. At least in this game we can manage the facing in view logic elegantly and save work in game mechanics, since at no point is facing game-state-dependently mixed in a given collection of cards or in any way influencing the game state internally.
